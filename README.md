# OFFICE_DESK_BOOKING
# Introduction:

System analysis is the process of studying the current system, identifying its strengths and weaknesses, and designing a new system that meets the user's requirements. In this case, the system analysis involves understanding the current process of booking workspaces and desks for employees and designing a new system to improve the process.
# Proposed System:

The proposed system is a web-based application that will allow employees to search for available workspaces and book a desk for a specific time period. The system will have two main modules: the admin module and the employee module.

The admin module will allow the admin to manage the workspace location, including adding locations, buildings, floors, and desks. The admin will also be able to view bookings made by employees. The employee module will allow employees to search for workspaces, view available desks, and book a desk for a specific time period. The employee will also be able to view their booking history and cancel a booking if needed.

The system will be implemented using Python programming language and Flask web framework for the back-end development, and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end development. The system will also use MySQL database for storing the data related to workspaces, bookings, and users.
# The system will have the following features:

1.Admin module:
- Add and view locations
- Add and view buildings
- Add and view floors
- Add and view desks
- View bookings

2. Employee module:
- Search workspaces
- View available desks
- Book a desk for a specific time period
- View booking history
- Cancel a booking
